dumb mistakes you will probably make:


don't forget to catch the mysqli link
        $link = connecttodb();
        
folders are friggin hard. Try not to fuck 'em up. here's a present:
         If the base document is 
         <URL:http://www.htmlhelp.com/faq/html/basics.html>, then


        all.html and ./all.html
                <URL:http://www.htmlhelp.com/faq/html/all.html>
        ./
                <URL:http://www.htmlhelp.com/faq/html/>
        ../
                <URL:http://www.htmlhelp.com/faq/>
        ../cgifaq.html
                <URL:http://www.htmlhelp.com/faq/cgifaq.html>
        ../../reference/
                <URL:http://www.htmlhelp.com/reference/>
                
how maek arrays????
        well do you want all the keys labelled? 
                $array = [ "key" => "value", "key2" => "value2"];
        if it doesn't matter:
                $array = [ "value", "value2"];
                
ESCAPE STRINGS. ALL THE TIME. USE THEM. DONT LET PEOPLE FUCK UP THE DATABASE.
string mysqli_real_escape_string ( mysqli $link , string $escapestr )
        
        checking for invalid characters
                        $result = preg_match('/[^0-9A-Za-z\ \.]/', $test_string);
                        \ is needed before addtl characters
                        returns 1 if there are bad characters
