man games would be cool


maths nightmare would be super easy.
what else is super simple.... 


some things the internet suggested        
pure js/php:
        4x4 tic-tac-toe
        othello
        blackjack
        battleship
        matching/memory
        hangman


needs an engine to run:        
        snake
        dodger (like monkey game)
        simon
        sliding puzzle
        jelly blobs
        
        hmm i guess i'd just do these in java...? um yeah i should figure out how to do interactive stuff i guess. im sure its possible, i feel like you dont need flash since you can kind of run whatever...?


idk how to save stuff (mysql?) so maybe just have a thing that says "if you leave the page progress will be lost"


man doing voltorb flip would be a lot of fun but haaa complicated
